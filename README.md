## /data_record
Contains experimental data for **GCN** and **DMPNN**, organized by category.

### GCN
- `/data_record/GCN/GCN_no_data_selection`  
  Results of hyperparameter optimization using Optuna without data selection.

- `/data_record/GCN/GCN_trying`  
  Results of hyperparameter optimization using different samplers in Optuna.

- `/data_record/GCN/Remove_MW_TPSA_outlier`  
  Results after applying data selection based on MW and TPSA to remove outliers.

### DMPNN
- `/data_record/DMPNN/No_data_selection`  
  Results of hyperparameter optimization using Optuna without data selection.

- `/data_record/DMPNN/N3_N7_ring_substructures`  
  Data selection based on compound substructures  
  (N3 = three-membered ring, N7 = seven-membered ring).  
  See the PPT inside the folder for details.

- `/data_record/DMPNN/Even class training`  
  Training datasets generated by clustering and oversampling minor classes  
  to achieve an even class distribution.  
  See the PPT inside the folder for details.

- `/data_record/DMPNN/remove_wwl_outlier`  
  Data selection based on the WWL distance matrix, using the IQR method  
  to remove outliers. See the PPT inside the folder for details.

## /Fingerpint
Fingerprint CSV files generated with **padelpy** for the datasets used in this study.

---

## /dataset
Datasets categorized according to different data selection methods.  
These files are directly used when running scripts in `/code`.

- `eli_duplcate_hf.csv`  
  Main file used for model training (baseline, no data selection).

- `regression_equal_no_ion_5_smaller.csv`  
  Original dataset passed down from a senior colleague.


---

## /compound_figure
Compound structures visualized using **RDKit**, ordered according to  
the SMILES column in `eli_duplcate_hf.csv`.
